## Advance Construct - Array

### Problem Statements

1. Given an array A of n integers, write a program (using rest parameters and different methods of array) to calculate the mean, median and mode.
2. Given an array A, where only one element can have single occurrence while the other will have two occurrence. You have to find out the element having a single occurrence.
    
    **Input**: [ 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 6 ]
    
    **Output**: 4
    
3. Given a string 'S' and a pair of multiple queries. Let the query pair be (L, R). So this pair (L, R) will correspond to substring S[L..R]. You need to determine if such a pair corresponds to substring S[L..R]. You need to determine if such pair corresponds to a palindrome substring or not.
    
    **Input**:
    
    abaaabaaaba, [0,10],
    
    abaaabaaaba, [5,8],
    
    abaaabaaaba, [2,5]
    
    **Output**:
    
    "The substring is a palindrome", 0, 10
    
    "The substring is not a palindrome", 5, 8
    
    "The substring is not a palindrome", 2, 5

## Advance Construct - Objects

### Problem Statements

4. Write a program to remove duplicate elements from the array
    
    **Input**: [ 6, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6 ]
    
    **Output**: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
